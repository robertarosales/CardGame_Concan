Game stages
1.	Shuffle
2.	Deal
3.	Players take turn to play clockwise
4.	Game ends when one player (aka. the winner) is out of cards

Shuffle
Before every game, shuffle the cards as much as possible to ensure randomness
Dealing
•	To choose who will start the first game, every player takes a random card from the pile. 
•	The one who draws the card with the highest value is the first player.
•	The first player deals him/herself 15 cards and everyone else 14 cards.
•	The winner of the current game is the first player in the next game.

Goal
The goal is to get rid of all the cards in your hand either by turning them into sets/straights or use them as lay off cards that are already in open play:

Melds
Melds consist of 3 or more cards and come in two variants:
• A Set is when cards are of the same rank but are of different suits, 
e.g. 4♥ 4♠ 4♦ or K♥ K♠ K♦ K♣.
• A Run is when cards are of consecutive ranks but are of the same suit, for example
J♣ Q♣ K♣ or 4♥ 5♥ 6♥ 7♥. 
Run sequence is A-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K or 2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K-A

Lay Off Cards
Lay off cards are cards that can be added to existing melds. 
E.g. for the Set meld 7♥ 7♠ 7♦, the card 7♣ can be added as a lay off card; and for the Run J♣ Q♣ K♣, both 10♣ and A♣ can be added as lay off cards.

How to play:
•	The cards that have not been dealt out to players are put, face down, in a draw pile. The discarded cards are put, face up, in a discard pile
•	The player who starts the round discards a card into the discard pile. 
•	Hence forth, all players have 14 cards in their hands.
•	Each player's turn starts when they draw a card and ends when they discard a card.
•	Opening your Hand by putting Melds Down: When gathering melds whose value sum is at least 51, the melds can be put down on the table face up.
•	The first player is not allowed to do a Melds Down before discarding that first card even if they have melds that sum up to at least 51
•	Before doing a Melds Down, the player may only draw a card from the draw pile. 
•	The exception is if the current player wants to use the card discarded by the previous player to do a Melds Down (typically, when the discarded card helps the current player form melds whose sum is at least 51). Then the current player can draw that card from the discarded pile instead of the draw pile and must do a Melds Down right away.
•	After doing a Melds Down, the player may draw the card discarded by the previous player instead of from the draw pile
•	During their turn and after doing a Melds Down, the player may put down, face up, any new melds he/she forms regardless of the sum of the new melds.
•	During their turn and after doing a Melds Down, the player can lay off cards on any meld on the table, regardless of who put the meld on the table
•	If a player discards a lay off card, the next player is allowed to use that card instead of drawing from the draw pile if that player had already done Melds Down.
•	Any player must always finish his/her turn by discarding a card, even the player who wins the game.
•	The Joker card can be played instead of any card the player chooses. If the player puts the Joker in a Set meld, he/she decides what suit the "Joker" has.
•	After doing a melds down, if the player has a Joker in his/her hand, they should announce that fact to the other players (see score count to understand why). If a player forgets to do so during his/her turn, they must wait until it's their turn again to do the announcement.
•	During their turn and after doing a melds down, a player may replace any Joker in any
•	meld on the table with the card the Joker represents. The player then does not need to announce having a Joker since taking it in sight of everyone else is considered an announcement.
•	During their turn, a player who had not done a Melds Down yet may choose to replace a Joker in any meld on the table if that Joker will help him/her do a Melds Down (typically, when the Joker helps the current player form melds whose sum is at least 51). The player must then do a Melds Down during that turn.

Score count:
•	The winner: -25 points. This is marked as "X" in the score sheet
•	A player who had had any melds down: The sum of the cards left in his/her hand. 
•	An announced Joker is counted as 2 and an unannounced Joker is counted as 25
•	A player who had not had any melds down: 100 points regardless of the sum of his/her cards
•	A game set is typically 9 rounds*. After the 9 rounds, the score of each player is summed up.
•	The winner of the whole set is the player who has the smallest sum**.
Tournament Styles:
•	Depending on how many who will participate in the tournament,
•	Divide into groups of 3 or 4 players, each group will play 3 or 4 games. The winners from each group will then face each other in a new game set.

•	Do not get disheartened by players who win the rounds. It is completely possible for you to lose every round and still win the set. A good strategy to achieve that is trying to get rid of the high value cards in your hand as soon as possible after doing a Melds Down.
